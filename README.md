# Vank Cliff - Next-Gen Liquidity Management & Payroll Platform

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT NOTICE**  
> Please notice that while merging front and backend we had an issue with a library and the live website broke. We wanted to launch the entire product on mainnet and live website. We integrated the same LP interface as kittipunch, but we couldn't integrate as we had some issues with integers in the pools. Alternatively, we have deployed a mock LP pool and a pair of erc20s as stablecoins.

We merged big commits, but please notice they are PRs of development and frontend/css changes :)
